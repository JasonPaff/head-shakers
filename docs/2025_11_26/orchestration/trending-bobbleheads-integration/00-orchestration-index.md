## Original Request

Integrate the style from the /home-page-demo trending bobblehead section into the real home page. No backwards compatible approach, use the new trending bobblehead design only. Make sure to match the color scheme used in the real home page hero section and real home pages feature collection section that have already been ported over from the /home-page-demo route. Must support light and dark mode.
