# Form Error Focus Management - Orchestration Index

**Feature**: TanStack Form Error Focus Management Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: In Progress

## Overview
Implementing focus management for TanStack Form to automatically focus the first errored field when invalid forms are submitted. This addresses the headless nature of TanStack Form which doesn't provide built-in focus management.

## Original Request
> The app uses tanstack-form with zod for forms. Tanstack-Form is headless and does not come with any built in focus management. The form components/integration in the app needs to be updated to focus the first errored field when invalid forms are submitted
