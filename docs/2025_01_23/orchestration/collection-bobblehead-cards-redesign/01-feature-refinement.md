## Original Request

The bobblehead cards on the collection page (/collection/[collectionSlug]) could use a visual overhaul and redesign to look clean, colorful, modern with a better UI/UX.

**Word Count**: 27 words

## Context Provided to Agent

- Next.js 16.0.3 with App Router, React 19.2.0, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- Radix UI component library (dialogs, dropdowns, forms, etc.)
- Lucide React for icons
- Class Variance Authority for component variants
- The project is a bobblehead collection platform called "Head Shakers"
- Components follow a structure: src/components/ui/ for reusable UI, src/components/feature/ for feature-specific components
- The collection page is at src/app/(app)/collection/[collectionSlug]/
- Uses $path from next-typesafe-url for all internal links

## Agent Prompt

```
Refine this feature request into a SINGLE PARAGRAPH (no headers, bullet points, or sections): "The bobblehead cards on the collection page (/collection/[collectionSlug]) could use a visual overhaul and redesign to look clean, colorful, modern with a better UI/UX."

Using this project context, expand this request with relevant technical details while maintaining its core intent.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY the refined paragraph (200-500 words)
- NO headers, NO bullet points, NO sections
- Single paragraph format ONLY
- Preserve original intent (visual redesign of bobblehead cards)
- Add only essential technical context
- Do NOT add features beyond visual redesign
```

## Agent Response (Refined Request)

The bobblehead cards displayed on the collection page (accessible via `/collection/[collectionSlug]`) require a comprehensive visual redesign to enhance the platform's overall aesthetic and user experience. Currently, the cards need to be modernized with a clean, colorful, and visually appealing design that aligns with contemporary UI/UX standards while leveraging the existing Head Shakers design system. The redesign should incorporate Radix UI components for consistency with the platform's established component library, Tailwind CSS 4 for modern styling and animations, and Class Variance Authority for flexible component variants that support different card states and layouts. The visual overhaul should improve the presentation of bobblehead metadata, making key information more discoverable and easier to scan, while implementing better visual hierarchy, improved spacing, and enhanced typography to create a more polished appearance. Lucide React icons should be strategically integrated to provide visual cues and improve navigation, and the cards should support modern interaction patterns such as hover effects, smooth transitions, and potentially expanded previews or detail views. The implementation should maintain type safety with TypeScript, ensure accessibility standards are met, and utilize internal navigation with `$path` from next-typesafe-url for any linked actions. This redesign is focused purely on the visual presentation and UX of the card components themselves—enhancing how bobblehead information is displayed, organized, and interacted with—rather than introducing new features or functionality, ensuring that the collection page feels modern, inviting, and competitive with contemporary web applications while reinforcing the platform's identity as a premium bobblehead collection management tool.
