## Original Request

"I want to implement the MVP version of the browse page. This will be the area of the site where people can easily and intuitively browse through collection and bobbleheads using filters and search fields. I don't want this to be the fully fleshed out super styled version of the browse page, I want to get the basic layout and everything working before we go crazy on styling and optimization."
