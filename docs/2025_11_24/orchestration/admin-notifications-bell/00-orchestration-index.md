# Admin Notifications Bell - Orchestration Index

**Feature**: Transfer admin newsletter notifications from toast to notifications bell
**Created**: 2025-11-24
**Status**: In Progress

## Workflow Overview

This orchestration follows a 3-step process to create a detailed implementation plan:

1. **Feature Refinement** - Enhance user request with project context
2. **File Discovery** - Find all relevant files for implementation
3. **Implementation Planning** - Generate detailed markdown implementation plan

## Original Request

The admin newsletter notification currently sends admin users a toast if they are on the /admin page when someone subscribes to the newsletter. I would like this behavior transferred to the notifications bell instead. If you are an admin user then when someone signs up for the newsletter then you get a new notification under the bell (which will show the count of unread notifications). Clicking the bell will show unread notifications (with a nice message when there are no notifications) and clicking the notification will make it faded and indicate it was acknowledged.
