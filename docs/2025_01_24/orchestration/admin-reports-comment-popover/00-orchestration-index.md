# Admin Reports Comment Popover - Orchestration Index

**Feature**: Admin Reports Comment Popover
**Created**: 2025-01-24
**Status**: In Progress

## Workflow Overview

This orchestration implements a popover to display reported comment content in the admin reports table, replacing the disabled link icon for comments.

## Original Request

> On the admin report pages reports table there is a column that includes a link to the reported content. This column is unable to link to comments so it uses a disabled icon. Since this column can't show a link to the comment I think it should show a different icon and that icon button would be a popover that shows the reported comment.
