# Bookmark Button Feature - Orchestration Index

**Feature**: One-click bookmark button on bobblehead detail page
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Status**: In Progress

## Workflow Overview

This orchestration follows a 3-step process to create a comprehensive implementation plan:

1. **Feature Request Refinement** - Enhance user request with project context
2. **File Discovery** - AI-powered discovery of relevant files across codebase
3. **Implementation Planning** - Generate detailed markdown implementation plan

## Navigation

- [01-feature-refinement.md](./01-feature-refinement.md) - Feature request refinement with project context
- [02-file-discovery.md](./02-file-discovery.md) - AI-powered file discovery analysis
- [03-implementation-planning.md](./03-implementation-planning.md) - Complete implementation plan generation

## Original Request

```
as a user I would like a one click bookmark button on the bobblehead detail page
```

## Execution Timeline

- **Started**: 2025-11-12T00:00:00Z
- **Step 1**: ✅ Completed (0:05)
- **Step 2**: ✅ Completed (0:05)
- **Step 3**: ✅ Completed (0:05)

- **Total Duration**: 15 minutes

## Summary

### Step 1: Feature Request Refinement
- ✅ Refined 16-word request to 299-word detailed requirement
- ✅ Added technical context from CLAUDE.md and package.json
- ✅ Format validation passed (single paragraph)
- ⚠️ Expansion ratio 18.7x (exceeded 2-4x target but within word count)

### Step 2: AI-Powered File Discovery
- ✅ Discovered 40 relevant files across all architectural layers
- ✅ Identified 16 new files to create
- ✅ Identified 17 existing files to modify
- ✅ Found 7 reference files for pattern templates
- ✅ All file paths validated for existence
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage: schemas, actions, queries, facades, hooks, components, pages, tests

### Step 3: Implementation Planning
- ✅ Generated 19-step implementation plan in markdown format
- ✅ All required sections present (Overview, Prerequisites, Steps, Quality Gates, Notes)
- ✅ Validation commands included in all 19 steps
- ✅ Estimated duration: 2-3 days, Complexity: Medium, Risk: Medium
- ✅ Template compliance verified
- ✅ No code examples (instructions only)

## Final Output

**Implementation Plan**: `docs/2025_11_12/plans/bookmark-button-implementation-plan.md`

The plan includes:
- 19 detailed implementation steps
- 40 files to create or modify
- Comprehensive testing strategy (5 test files)
- Quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Architecture following existing like feature patterns

**Ready for execution**: Use `/implement-plan docs/2025_11_12/plans/bookmark-button-implementation-plan.md` to begin implementation
