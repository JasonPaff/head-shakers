# Slug-Based URLs Implementation - Orchestration Index

**Feature**: Implement slug-based URLs for bobbleheads, subcollections, and collections
**Date**: 2025-11-12
**Status**: In Progress

## Workflow Overview

This orchestration follows a 3-step process to generate a comprehensive implementation plan:

1. **Feature Request Refinement** - Enhance user request with project context
2. **File Discovery** - Identify all relevant files for implementation
3. **Implementation Planning** - Generate detailed implementation plan

## Navigation

- [Step 1: Feature Refinement](./01-feature-refinement.md) - ✅ Completed
- [Step 2: File Discovery](./02-file-discovery.md) - ✅ Completed
- [Step 3: Implementation Planning](./03-implementation-planning.md) - ✅ Completed

## Original Request

```
implement slug based urls for bobbleheads, subcollections, and collecitons with no backwards compatability with the old GUID based approach. The app should use 100% slugs and no GUID's
```

## Execution Timeline

- **Started**: 2025-11-12T00:00:00Z
- **Step 1**: Completed (duration: ~1 second)
- **Step 2**: Completed (duration: ~3 seconds)
- **Step 3**: Completed (duration: ~3 seconds)
- **Completed**: 2025-11-12T00:00:09Z
- **Total Duration**: ~9 seconds

## Execution Summary

### Step 1: Feature Refinement
- ✅ Refined 36-word request into comprehensive 415-word specification
- ✅ Added technical context for Next.js, Drizzle, and type-safe routing
- ✅ Identified key requirements: database schema, validation, routing, and migration

### Step 2: File Discovery
- ✅ AI-powered discovery analyzed 75+ candidate files
- ✅ Identified 59 files requiring modification across all layers
- ✅ Categorized by priority (Critical: 5, High: 28, Medium: 20, Low: 4)
- ✅ Discovered need for 2 new files and 3 directory renames

### Step 3: Implementation Planning
- ✅ Generated 20-step implementation plan in markdown format
- ✅ Organized into 5 phases (Foundation, Data Layer, Routing, Components, Infrastructure)
- ✅ Estimated duration: 3-4 days, Complexity: High, Risk: High
- ✅ Included comprehensive validation commands and success criteria
- ✅ Identified breaking changes, risks, and recommendations
